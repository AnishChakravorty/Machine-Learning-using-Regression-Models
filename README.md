# TechWorks Consulting Salary Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the machine learning project for TechWorks Consulting, aimed at predicting the salaries of newly hired employees. The project leverages historical employee data and various features such as education, city, role, previous CTC, experience, and academic performance to train a regression model that can estimate salaries with high accuracy.

## Objective
The goal is to assist TechWorks Consulting in making data-driven salary decisions for their new hires, thereby optimizing their recruitment process and ensuring fair compensation practices.

## Background

TechWorks Consulting has emerged as a leader in the IT staffing industry, renowned for its innovative approach to matching top-tier IT talent with the right job opportunities. With a rich history of success, the company has built a reputation for its rapid and efficient placement services, catering to businesses ranging from burgeoning startups to established corporations.

The foundation of TechWorks Consulting's success lies in its unique methodology—a robust database of qualified candidates and a team of seasoned recruiters adept at identifying the perfect match for any position. This approach has not only set TechWorks Consulting apart but also solidified its position as a trusted partner for companies in need of IT expertise.

As the company continues to expand its services, it remains committed to providing fair and competitive compensation to its employees. This commitment is reflected in the company's meticulous salary determination process, which considers a multitude of factors such as market rates, individual skills and experience, and performance evaluations.

In this case study, we delve into the development of a machine learning model designed to enhance TechWorks Consulting's salary determination process. The model aims to predict the salaries of newly hired employees by analyzing historical data and various features, ensuring consistency and fairness in compensation across the organization.

This project encapsulates the journey from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, highlighting the role of statistics and machine learning in making data-driven decisions. It serves as a testament to TechWorks Consulting's dedication to leveraging cutting-edge technology to maintain its competitive edge in the IT staffing domain.

## Tools Used

- Anaconda
- Microsoft VS-code
- Jyupter Notebook
- Python Libraries
- MS-Excel


## Approach

### Data Preprocessing:

- Convert the “College” field into numerical data based on the tier of the college.
- Convert the “City” field into numerical data (0 for non-metro and 1 for metro cities).
- Create dummy variables for the “Role” field.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize features if necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Visualize the distribution of salary.
- Explore relationships between features and salary (scatter plots, histograms, etc.).
- Identify any interesting patterns or insights.

### Feature Engineering:

- Create new features if necessary (e.g., combining existing features).
- Explain the rationale behind feature engineering choices.

### Model Selection and Training:

- Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Train the model using historical data.

### Evaluation and Interpretation:

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and AIC.
- Interpret the model coefficients.

### Improvement Strategies:

- Fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Consider feature engineering.
- Explore other regression models.

## Conclusion 

- Summarize the findings.
- Reflect on the overall success of the model.
- Suggest areas for improvement (e.g., collecting more data, refining features).
